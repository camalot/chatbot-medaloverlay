## MEDAL OVERLAY

[![](https://i.imgur.com/bby6d49.png)](https://medal.tv/?ref=DarthMinos_partner)

This is a [StreamLabs Chatbot](https://streamlabs.com/chatbot) Script that allows chat to trigger a [Medal](https://medal.tv/?ref=DarthMinos_partner) clip creation, and then play the clip back on stream.  

This will trigger playback on stream if your community triggers the clip creation, or if you press the hotkey to trigger a clip.

[![See Medal Overlay In Action](https://img.youtube.com/vi/q2mIDQ8BcW4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2mIDQ8BcW4)

There is a second overlay that is available with this script that allows continuous playback of your uploaded Medal clips.

## RECENT CLIPS SETUP IN OBS / SLOBS 
See Above for sample images on these steps.

- Add a new `Browser Source` in OBS / SLOBS  
- **DO NOT** check `Local File`. To get the URL of the overlay, you can click on the `OPEN RECENT CLIPS OVERLAY IN BROWSER` and copy the URL from your browser address bar.
- Set the `height` and `width` to the size you would like the video to be on your scene. 
- Add any additional custom CSS that you would like to add.
- Check both `Shutdown source when not visible` and `Refresh browser when scene becomes active`.  


## CUSTOM CSS

You can customize the look with custom css to add a border, or other styles to the video. Just edit the `custom.css` file, or you can use the `custom css` in SLOBS/OBS. 

Here is an example that uses a background uploaded to imgur.
```css
#video-container .video-box {
  /* This is the container that holds the video-border-box and the video elements */
}

#video-container .video-box .video-border-box {
	/* This container sits directly on top of the video and is sized the same as the video */
}

#video-container .video-box video {
	/* This is the video container */
}

progress[value] {
	/* change the height and position of the progress bar */
	/* height: 7px; */
	/* left: 113px; */
	/* padding: 0 113px 0 0 */
	/* margin: 0 0 3px 0 */
}

progress::-webkit-progress-value {
	/* set the bar color */
  /*background: #57d12a;*/
}

```

## TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Files are served to the overlay via a lightweight http server called [tinyweb](https://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/tinyweb/install.php). It binds to port `9191` by default, and can be configured in the options. It also binds to the local internal address so the files are only accessible to the overlay. If you run chatbot on a different machine than you run OBS/SLOBS there will be an issue and it will not function correctly.
